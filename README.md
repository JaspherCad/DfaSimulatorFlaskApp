5) IF THIS ERROR SHOWS (PROBABLY, it is normal because our app requires installation of GraphizEXE
*POTENTIAL ERROR NAME*
error name:
ExecutableNotFound
graphviz.backend.execute.ExecutableNotFound: failed to execute WindowsPath('dot'), make sure the Graphviz executables are on your systems' PATH

Meaning you have to download
INSTALL GRAPHIZ ON DESKTOP. not on terminal but an actual EXE sa google.

windows_10_cmake_Release_graphviz-install-12.1.2-win64.exe this could be the SOFTWARE name??
* run installer
* during installation make sure to check the option to 'add graphiz to your System's path'
* if ok na, go to powershell/cmd then command => dot -v (to show version of graphiz)


5) additional tip. IF ERROR AFTER ALL THAT, "select interpreter" at vs studio. use the RECOMMENDED
